        <h1>Hi! I am learning something new. </h1>
        
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Jessica, a front-end development student passionate about creating functional and beautiful interfaces. 
        I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to build increasingly interactive applications. 
        I enjoy turning ideas into visible projects and believe that every line of code is a step forward in my journey as a developer.</p>

        <h2>What I’m Learning</h2>
        <p>My focus is on web development. I’ve been practicing HTML to structure pages, CSS to create responsive and attractive layouts, 
        and I’m starting to explore JavaScript to add interactivity to my projects. 
        I’m also learning about best practices for code organization and version control using Git and GitHub.</p>

        <h2>My Next Steps</h2>
        <p>In the coming months, I plan to develop more complete projects, applying concepts of responsiveness, animations, and API integration. 
        I also want to explore frameworks like React to take my skills to the next level. 
        My goal is to build a solid portfolio that showcases my growth and creativity as a developer.</p>
